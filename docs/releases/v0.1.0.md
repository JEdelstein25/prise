# Prise v0.1.0 — "One Among The Fence"

The first public release of Prise, a terminal multiplexer for modern terminals.

## Highlights

- **Client-Server Architecture** — The server persists sessions across client connections, so your work survives disconnects
- **Lua-Powered UI** — The entire interface is implemented in Lua and fully customizable
- **Session Management** — Named sessions with tabs and panes, persisted to disk
- **Tiling Window Manager** — Split panes horizontally/vertically, resize, zoom, and navigate with vim-style keybinds
- **Command Palette** — Fuzzy-searchable command palette (Super+p)
- **Modern Terminal Features** — Built on libghostty and libvaxis for proper terminal emulation
